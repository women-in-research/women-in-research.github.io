We are very excited to offer our first workshop within the Women in Research initiative! This two-session workshop will focus on leadership skills for women and will be led by Svenja Neupert, who has extensive expertise as a trainer in this area. The first session will focus on self-management, including topics such as finding your role as a female leader, dealing with discrimination and setbacks, and time/workload management. The theme of the second session will be cultural blocks and chances for women in academia. In this session, we will learn about hidden strategies and glass ceilings in academia and how to build and lead diverse teams of researchers.

The workshop will take place in a hybrid format for those who aren't able to attend in person. Details will be sent to MGK members by email.

Workshop dates:
Session 1: November 10, 2022 from 9am-12pm
Session 2: November 17, 2022 from 9am-12pm
